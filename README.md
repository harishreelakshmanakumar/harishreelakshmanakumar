## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

Hey there! I'm Harishree — a builder at heart and a problem solver by passion. I love turning complex ideas into real-world software, especially when it involves web technology, artificial intelligence, or both.

Right now, I’m wearing multiple hats at **Twincord Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**, where I lead engineering projects and also drive HR initiatives. It's a unique blend of tech and team building, and I enjoy every bit of it.

Whether I’m developing full-stack applications, training deep learning models, or mentoring a new hire, my goal is the same: **create meaningful solutions and grow every day**.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me presenting at tech fests, earning new certifications, or exploring what's next in AI and cloud.
